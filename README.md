The course in PySpark programming has helped me to learn the basics of Spark infrastructure and how spark can process data in stand-alone machine on on cluster running on AWS EMR (using YARN manager). Below features have been covered as foundations to my learning:

- RDD (Resilient Distributed Datasets)
- Spark SQL
- DataFrame APIs
- Spark ML - Processing movie recommendations data using ml models like ALS and Logistic Regression
